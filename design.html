        <p>This document describes the various design decisions and known
           limitations of Scriptlet Workshop.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Target audience</dt>
            <dd>Scriptlet Workshop was initially written to teach a
                beginners' programming course at the Year 7&ndash;8 level.
                At this age group, a very effective way to teach is just
                by having the students cut and paste from simple programs,
                editing them, and observing the effects thereof. The
                structure of programming can then be built upon their
                first-hand experiences.</dd>

        <h1 id="sysreqs">System requirements</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>Java 6 requirement</dt>
            <dd>Scriptlet Workshop requires Java 6. I have tried very hard
                to sidestep this requirement, so that it could work in Java
                5, but because <code>javax.script.ScriptEngineManager</code>
                uses <code>sun.misc.Service</code>, which is not in a
                package that untrusted applet code is allowed to access,
                <span class="file">script-api.jar</span> would have to be
                installed in a trusted location. Most normal users lack
                the privileges and/or expertise required for this.</dd>
            <dt>Non-usage of <code>BrowserJS</code></dt>
            <dd>An applet runs in a web browser, and would be a natural
                candidate for using the <code>BrowserJS</code> engine
                to invoke scriptlet code. However, the scriptlet engine
                (<code>com.sun.scriptlet.Scriptlet</code>) was not designed
                for use with <code>BrowserJS</code>, and extensive changes
                would be required for this to work (for example, obtaining
                the window object would have to be done in a completely
                different way that is not engine-agnostic).</dd>
        </dl>
        <h1 id="structure">Code structure</h1>
        <p>For the purposes of this section, the <dfn>frontend code</dfn>
           is that which is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine,
           and the <dfn>backend code</dfn> is that which is executed by
           the Java Runtime Environment's JavaScript engine.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Flaws in the original design</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>In the initial version of the program, the entirety of
                   the backend code was dynamically generated from the
                   contents of the textareas, and then pushed through to
                   the scriptlet engine as a <code>param</code>. This has
                   some notable drawbacks:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In testing with Java 6u3 and Firefox 2.0.0.9, I have
                        encountered many cases where applet initialisation
                        failure caused the Java Plugin to eat 100% CPU and
                        Firefox to freeze. Thus any way to avoid allowing
                        the applet to fail to load is highly desirable.</li>
                    <li>Any syntax (or other) error in the textareas would
                        cause the whole scriptlet to fail to load, with no
                        indication of the cause other than via Java Console
                        (which is not very user-friendly). This also does
                        not identify for the learner where they need to
                        find and correct the errors.</li>
                    <li>Passing a whole script via a <code>param</code>
                        caused newlines to be stripped off. This made
                        single-line comments unusable, and also threw off
                        line numbering in error messages entirely.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The below items describe how I addressed these points
                   in the updated design.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Usage of static backend</dt>
            <dd>For robustness, I have relocated the backend code to its
                own static file, which will parse and load successfully
                without regard to what's in the textareas (assuming there
                aren't any bugs left in the backend, that is).</dd>
            <dt>Error handling</dt>
            <dd>Rather than building one big chunk of code from the textareas,
                the backend creates function objects for each textarea, and
                wraps them in a <code>try</code> block so that any run-time
                error doesn't spill out of the backend. Also, a similar
                <code>try</code> is used around the actual creation of the
                function objects, so that syntax errors also don't spill
                out.</dd>
            <dt>Newline preservation</dt>
            <dd>Instead of passing script text in a <code>param</code>, the
                frontend passes element IDs of the textareas that the backend
                retrieves directly from the document object model. This also
                opens up other possibilities, such as a button in the form
                that allows scriptlet code (other than the <code>init</code>
                method) to be updated without reinitialising the applet.</dd>
